# Market Research

Market research unveils a growing trend among health-conscious individuals seeking both performance and style in their fitness apparel. ShapeShift, a B2C platform, targets this clientele, offering a curated selection of high-quality activewear and accessories.

Much like luxury cars symbolize status, fitness apparel has become a statement of dedication to wellness. Shapeshift is aiming to promote itself by driving an increased interest in premium fitness wear that seamlessly blends functionality and fashion.

Statistics highlight a rising consumer inclination towards investing in top-tier activewear. ShapeShift's B2C model strategically positions it to cater to this evolving demand, providing consumers with a range of stylish yet performance-driven options. It's a go-to destination for those seeking to enhance their fitness journey with premium, trendsetting activewear.

## Target Audience

From the research I've done on sites like Google Analytics and Statista.com there are THREE types of people who "Shapeshift" will appeal to.

### Lower Class: 
People who do not have lots of money can still find the website appealing as it offers free diet and workout advice and can buy acessories as they do not cost a lot.


### Middle Class :

People who make average income and can afford  some of the clothes that are on offer and acessories.

### Wealthy People :

People that can afford to buy anything on the website as they make a lot of money and are looking for either very expensive sport clothes which the website has or they are looking for cool acessories.

## Market Strategy

### Utilizing Facebook as our primary marketing platform presents an opportunity to reach a vast audience of potential customers. With its extensive user base and diverse targeting options, we can tailor our campaigns to resonate with specific demographics interested in fitness, fashion, and active lifestyles.


We would use the shapeshift facebook page to create campaigns and promote our page by boosting our posts and using facebook ads.


![facebook](Add screenshot of facebook page)

### Our secondary marketing platform is Instagram as it has a lot of users interested in working out and clothing and works very well with Facebook.

On Instagram we could collab with a popular instagram user and ask them to promote our shapeshift merch we would send them free clothes and acessories and ask them for a promotion or a hashtag in return to create views and potential customers for our website.


![instagram](add insta influencer)

## Mailchimp

Our newsletter sign-up is a vital part of our marketing strategy. It lets users subscribe for exclusive promotions and updates. The collected email lists enable our admin to send subscribers rewards, discounts, and insider info, fostering a loyal customer base.

# Agile

In order to complete this project I have used the Agile Methodology. This involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks called User Stories. These user stories were added using githubs Issues functionality. Each user story was made into an issue and added to the projects kanban board. 


You can view my user stories in the kanban [board here.](https://github.com/users/Gabriel5638/projects/7/views/1)

# User Experience

## Scope

In order to present the user with a compelling experience and have him enjoy his visit on our website, Shapeshift needs to tick a few boxes. The list below is an absolute must if we would like the user to return and recommend us to others.

- A landing page that makes it very apparent what the site is used for.

- A Products Page that displays all of the Products found in the category or through the search.

- Products Cards that display an image of the item, its name, price, and an option to click for further information.

- A Search Bar, My Account Links, Shopping Cart Links, and Product Categories sections are included in the site navigation.

# Design Scheme
To make this project stand out among other fitness websites that offer similar things I decided to offer free diets and workout routines and make the pages look very attractive and flashy especially the diet page using videos of food related to the specific diet as where other subscription based websites ask for money I would offer these for free to attract customers.

This was done with aid of cool videos, of foods being prepared I found on pexels I will go more into detail about them in the "Features" section.

## Colors

I chose a very simple yet easy to view color scheme. Black and White while in some parts I used blue for the buttons and in the diets sections I used more greens just to make it stand out. But the website color scheme is mostly black and white and easy on the eyes

The Hero image dark background on the home page works very well with the black and white scheme which is why I chose it.

I used COOLORS to generate this:

![colors](add collors)


## Fonts

- I used a font named Montserrat because I like the way it looks and how the writing looks on my website. 

- You can find the font here [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=Montserrat)

## Images

- Clothing and acessories images were taken from pintrest and the backgrounds and hero image and videos in the home workout and diet sections were taken from pexels.


# Data Scheme

- Used DrawSQL to present my models

![data](add draw sql datamodel img here)

# Features

- I made a unique logo for the header using bootstrap.
- The navigation is very simple and contains all the categories.

## Footer

- On the left the search bar is placed, I wanted to place it at the bottom, so the user can intuitively look through the page a and see what it has to offer before searching for something.
- I have links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube in the footer section.
- When you hover over the icons, you get feedback and they are totally interactive.
- To avoid diverting the user, when an icon is clicked, the page will open in a new tab.

## Hero Image
![hero](add hero img)
- I chose this as my hero image because I think it embodies everything the website is.
- On the right the user can see the white website description which works well with the dark background of the hero image.
- Added a button beside the image that takes the user straight to the all product section of the shop, so that weather they are a man or woman they can view all the items and decide after if they wish to browse either men or women section instead of taking a woman user to the mens section of the shop or vice versa.

# STRIPE

- On this project we implemented a service called Stripe to handle payments from our customers.
- Once you set up webhooks successfully you should be able to see payments succeed in your Stripe dashboard.
- If you would like to test purchase anything on my website you can use these card details:
    - Card number: 
    - expiry: 
    - cvs: add the number after integrating stripe

### As you can see my Stripe webhooks and payments have gone through successfully.

# Testing

I have conducted thorough testing of the website, as well as some close friends who I have instructed to test the site.

## Manual Testing

## User Story Testing

1. As a user I can use the recover password options so that to recover my password in case i forget

    - The 'Forgot Password' option at the bottom of the login page was used to test this. A link is then sent to the user through email, so I tested this with an already-sent email to be sure the link was received.

    - The user must wait for the password reset link to be received before using it. Once it does, they are directed to a website where they must input their old password twice in order to reset it. The user is led to a confirmation page with a bootstrap toast displaying a success message after entering the new password. An error notice alerts the user so they can try again if the passwords do not match.


2. As a user I can easily register for an account on the website so that receive benefits of a logged in user

    - This was tested by registering a couple of user accounts and:
        - making sure they worked by logging out and back in.
        - clicking the confirmation link in the email
        - scanning for verified email addresses in the admin panel.
        - using an already-existing email address to attempt to create an account


 3. As a user I can search by using a simple searchbar so that i can find exactly the product im looking for
    - I tested this by searching using the search bar in the footer and also by searching through the category links
    - The number showed matched the number of searches on each page, and it can be found on the all products page.

4. As a user I can sort products by specific category easily so that i can choose which type of product I want

    - I went to the all the product views and tested every single sorting option in the "sort by" section.
        - this included : Sort by name, sort by category and sort by price.
        - all of those options returned expected results


5. As a user I can see my order details so that i can verify the product i chose and the price
    - I selected a product put in the from the cart and clicked check out
    - After inputting my details , i clicked on secure checkout and was presented with my order details
    - I tried multiple times with various values trying to trick the form but it worked every time

6. As a user I can pay safely without having to worry about my details being stole so that i can shop with confidence
    - If the user has an account, address details can be saved and updated/removed as needed. By adding and deleting addresses from the profile page, this was put to the test. In order to verify that the address was saved on the User's Profile page after checkout, it was also inserted and saved to the profile.

    - The project makes use of Stripe to handle payments, protecting customer payment information and preventing it from being saved in their user profile.

7. As a user I can adjust the products I saved in my cart so that i can remove products.
    - I added a product to my cart and then went to the shopping cart page
    - Once on the page i was presented with the correct information as expected
    - Once I tried adjusting the Products that i added to my cart , the update went through without any issue
    - I tried multiple times to trick the system by refreshing the page etc.

8. As a user I can buy products without being logged in
    - Without being logged into an account, an order was placed. To make sure it matched what was put in the bag and afterwards checked out, it was tested by comparing the order confirmation, email confirmation, and the order within the order model. 

9. As a user I can easily view a list of products ** so that ** I can decide which one to buy
    - Once I clicked on the shop button I was presented with a well ordered list of products with the right sizes.
    - The products are displayed using bootstrap  and are very responsive due to their classes, which means the layout of the products changes with screen size.
    - All images are displayed unless theres no image, at which point the site will display a default image.

10. As a user I can click on a specific product  so that I can see relevant information about its caracteristics
    - I clicked on a product, it took me to the product details page
    - On the page it shows specific details such as size comments and ratings and of course the user can add to cart.
    - I checked different product to see if any description is the same and all of them were different

11. As a user I can sign up for the newsletter so that i can receive the latest updates
    - The user can subscribe by providing their email and clicking submit. An error warning shows below the email box if there is a problem with the email. If successful, a success message is displayed instead.

    - By subscribing with a test email and logging into Mailchimp to view the contacts, the subscription was tested. After making sure the contact was present, I scanned the page to check if they had subscribed.

12. As a user I can add payment info easily when checking out so that i dont have to spend much time before buying
    - Submitted an order while simply filling out the checkout form's mandatory information. Both Stripe and the Database successfully processed the order, which was also recorded with a success Webhook message.

    - Attempted to place an order using the wrong card information. The wrong details are confirmed by an error message that displays beneath the card details form.

    - Tried to place an order with a card that has expired. The card has expired, according to an error message that displays beneath the card details form.

    - Attempting to send a purchase order with a missing order form. All blank necessary fields notify the user that they must be filled out in order for the form to be finished and submitted.

13. As a user I can visit their facebook store page so that interact with the comunity closer
    - I scrolled down to the footer where the facebook icon is located
    - Click on the Icon and was taken directly to their facebook page
    - It opened in a new window as expected and didnt close the previous one
    - Also tested the icons in the home page and they all work

14. As a user I can add  products into my shopping cart so that I can see how much i am spending and the total cost
    - I verified to make sure the right product was added before adding an item to the cart.

    - In order to make sure the quantity in the cart matched what was added, I raised the quantity before adding it.


15. As a user I can receive a confirmation email when registering so that click the confirmation link be sure i am registered
    - By sending an order to an email address that can be verified, email confirmation was tried. The right order data and a contact email were included in an email confirmation that was sent in accordance with the template set up in the checkout app.



16. As a superuser I can edit a car products so that I can change its price, details, description
    - You can edit products in two ways, one using the admin panel and another using the edit button which appears if youre logged in as superuser.
    - I checked if that edit button appeared otherwise and it didnt if youre not a superuser.
    - Clicked the edit button and was able to edit every single field , price description etc
    - Also checked the admin panel for editing and it was the same situation everything worked without issue

18. As a superuser I can change a normal users permisions so that I can stop a user from using my website if needed
    - That can be done from the admin panel by clicking on their email and selecting the remove option.
    - This was indeed possible if you are logged into the admin panel and the user was deleted from the database.

19. As a superuser I can send emails to customers so that I can sell my products
    - When a customer signs up for emails, their information is added to the company's Mailchimp contacts list, where they can later be removed.

    - This was checked by sending an email to subscribe and then verifying that it was received by checking the Mailchimp email list. In order to make sure it was simple to remove an email from the email list, I also looked at the unsubscribe functionality.

20. As a superuser I can add different categories to products or change existing products** so that I am able to manage each product properly
    - I tested this by logging into the admin panel and clicking on the products section and then clicking what category I wanted for the list.
    - I could indeed add a product to a category and change the products category at any time


21. As a superuser I can delete Products and manage my store when products are not available anymore
    - I tested this by clicking on delete Product in admin panel.
    - If deleted the product does not show up in any category and searching for it will not cause it to show up.
    - I tested to see if you could return to an old product but got the 404 error page
